Project Description: Startup Funding Data Cleaning & Analysis

The Startup Funding Data Cleaning & Analysis Project focuses on transforming raw, inconsistent funding datasets into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format. The project involves identifying missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, standardizing investor names, normalizing funding amounts, and categorizing startup sectors. Using data-cleaning techniques in Python/Power BI, the dataset is prepared to extract meaningful insights into funding patterns.

After cleaning, the project analyzes key metrics such as total funding raised, top investors, sector-wise investment trends, and year-on-year funding growth. The cleaned dataset enables accurate visualizations and dashboards for decision-making. This project helps stakeholders understand which sectors attract the most investment, how funding trends evolve over time, and who the major contributors in the startup ecosystem are.

Overall, the project demonstrates the complete pipeline from data preprocessing → cleaning → validation → exploratory analysis → visualization, ensuring high data quality and reliable insights for startup-investment analytics
